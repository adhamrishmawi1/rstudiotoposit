This RMarkdown document presents a preliminary analysis of Seattle&rsquo;s [pet licenses dataset](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb). It interleaves text, code, and code output. 

## Loading the Dataset

The following code *chunk* loads the tidyverse library, reads the CSV file containing the Seattle pet license dataset, and saves that dataset under the name `seattle_pets`. The code assumes that the CSV file is loaded in a sub-directory, `data`, of the directory that contains this document.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
seattle_pets <- read_csv("data/Seattle_Pet_Licenses.csv")
```

## Viewing the Structure of the Dataset

We can now view the dataset as it is stored in R.

```{r pets}
seattle_pets
```

Based on the information provided in the previous section, we can see that the pets dataset contains how many of the following:

- Pets (i.e., rows, a.k.a. *records*):44565  
- Variables (i.e., columns, a.k.a. *fields*):  7

## Analyzing the Dataset

We can now count the number of each species using the `count()` function.

```{r count-by-species}
count(seattle_pets, Species, sort=TRUE)
```

different types of species and we could determine the largest species in this csv file

```{r count-by-name}
count(seattle_pets, `Animal's Name`, sort=TRUE)
```
