## Claim
Does Covid-19 differ in infection rates from country to country? (Egypt vs Jordan vs Israel?)


## Structure of data
This data consists of plenty of numerical and categorical variables (34 to be precise). The data set also consists of plenty of observations which amount to 189999!

* I do not intend to use all the variables in my graph but they are very valuable and understandable!*
